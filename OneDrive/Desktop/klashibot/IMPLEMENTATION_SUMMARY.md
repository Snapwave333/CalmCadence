- **Drawdown Protection**: Automatic trading halt on excessive drawdown
- **Daily Loss Limits**: Maximum daily loss before stopping
- **Correlation Risk**: Limits exposure to correlated positions
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous risk assessment and alerting

### Data & Models
- **Feature Engineering**: Technical indicators, market microstructure, and time-based features
- **Historical Data**: SQLite storage for market data, features, and outcomes
- **Model Retraining**: Automatic model retraining based on configurable intervals
- **Performance Tracking**: Model accuracy and strategy performance metrics

### Execution & Monitoring
- **Smart Execution**: Limit orders with optimal pricing strategies
- **Order Management**: Full order lifecycle tracking and management
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live market data
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging with performance metrics
- **Alert System**: Configurable alerts for important events

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- **Core**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn for data analysis and ML
- **API**: aiohttp, websockets for async API communication
- **Database**: sqlite3 for local data storage
- **Logging**: structlog for structured logging
- **Config**: pydantic, python-dotenv for configuration management
